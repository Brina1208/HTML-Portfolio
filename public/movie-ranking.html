<h2>My top 3 favourite movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>This one really made me think.</p>
<h3>Nimona</h3>
<p>Even though it's a kid's movie, it teaches a valuable lesson about acceptance.</p>
<h3>Doctor Strange</h3>
<p>It's Matvel and it's Benedict Cumberbatch. What else do we need?</p>
